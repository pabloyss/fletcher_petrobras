Problem is anisotropic with tilted transversely isotropy using sigma=0.750000
Grid size is (248,248,248) with spacing (12.50,12.50,12.50); simulated area (3087.50,3087.50,3087.50) 
Grid is extended by 16 absortion points and 4 border points at each extreme
Wave is propagated at internal+absortion points of size (280,280,280)
Source at coordinates (144,144,144)
Will run 200 time steps of 0.001000 to reach time 0.200000
