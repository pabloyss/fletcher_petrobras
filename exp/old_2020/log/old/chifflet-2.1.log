Problem is anisotropic with tilted transversely isotropy using sigma=0.750000
Grid size is (216,216,216) with spacing (12.50,12.50,12.50); simulated area (2687.50,2687.50,2687.50) 
Grid is extended by 16 absortion points and 4 border points at each extreme
Wave is propagated at internal+absortion points of size (248,248,248)
Source at coordinates (128,128,128)
Will run 100 time steps of 0.001000 to reach time 0.100000
